                        <h2>Challenge 3</h2>
                        <p>Realizing that diversity and inclusiveness is a strength and not a weakness, you become a team of “RBC’s”. You keep walking but at this point the team becomes really tired and thirsty. So you enter the coffee shop aptly named “Java’s Clients”. After 5 hours waiting, you still haven’t received your order and you realize you can actually program the servers and the coffee shop yourself to make them more client focused.  They haven’t earned the right to be your first choice, so you create a program to help them do just that.
