                        <p>After getting out of the cave you find out that you completed the first obstacle and without your team of “R”’s you wouldn’t have been successful. As one team you were able to accomplish more than if you did it individually. By this time you and the “R”’s have become pretty close so when you reach your second obstacle and meet the “C”s , all three of you ignore them. Unfortunately, you quickly realize to finish your second problem which deals with Vitamin C++, you’ll need the help of the C’s.
                    You apologize and bring them onto your team to help you solve this problem:
